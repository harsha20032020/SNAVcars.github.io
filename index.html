<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>India is a vast and unique country. Being a developing country, India presents many opportunities to innovate. 
Being residents of urban cities, we noticed one such opportunity. There are lots of people who have bought cars-
 but don't use them much. We also have a huge crowd of young people who move into the cities every year, entering the workforce. 
These younger working-class need cars too.  So there lies an opportunity, a market for us to capture. India does not really need a 
lot more cars or bikes than we already have. We need to improve the 'efficiency' of existing vehicles. When a vehicle is purchased 
for lakhs of rupees and then only used for a few thousand kilometers a year, that's wasted efficiency. We have identified this as a 
grave problem which needs to be addressed immediately, amongst the rising concerns of road traffic, pollution, etc. Thus, we offer a 
solution, that is, by introducing a common platform for both parties (i.e., owners of the cars and the people who need cars but don't 
have the resources to own them).  Our proposition wishes to explore this gap in detail and to solve it using our model. </p>
